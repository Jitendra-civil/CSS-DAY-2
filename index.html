    <h3>BOX-SIZING</h3>
    <P>The CSS box-sizing property is used to specify how to calculate the total height and width of an element.<BR>
        It controls the size of an element with a specified height and width.<BR>
        It allows you to include the padding and border within the total height and width of the element.
        content-box: As per the CSS standard, it is the default value of the box-sizing property. <br>
        By using this value, the height and width properties will only include the content and do not include margin, padding, or border values.<br>
        border-box: The border-box is a widely used value of the box-sizing property.<br>
         It informs the browser to adjust the border and padding within the specified height and width of an element.</P>
         <h3>ANIMATION-DELAY</h3>
         <p>The animation-delay CSS property specifies the amount of time to wait from applying the animation to an element before beginning to perform the animation. <br>
            The animation can start later, immediately from its beginning, or immediately and partway through the animation.
            <div class="box"></div></p>
            <h3>MERGING</h3>
            <p>CSS GRID-row property you will use to merge cells vertically in grid.</p>
            <p>CSS GRID-column property you will use to merge cells horizontally in grid.</p>
            <h3>CSS BOX MODEL</h3>
            <P>Border:<BR>
                It is a region between the padding-box and the margin. Its proportions are determined by the width and height of the boundary.<BR>
                Margin:<BR>
                This segment consists of the area between the boundary and the edge of the border.<BR>
                 The proportion of the margin region is equal to the margin-box width and height. It is better to separate the product from its neighbor nodes.<BR>
                Padding:<BR>
                This field requires the padding of the component. In essence, this area is the space around the subject area and inside the border-box. <BR>
                Content:<BR>
                Material such as text, photographs, or other digital media is included in this area.<BR>
                It is constrained by the information edge, and its proportions are dictated by the width and height of the content enclosure.<BR></P>
                    <h3>DISPLAY NONE AND VISIBILITY HIDDEN:</h3>
                    <p> display: none essentially removes the element completely from the document. <BR>
                        The attached element does not take up any space, even though it's still in the source code.<BR>
                        Visibility: hidden hides the tag, but it still takes up space and affects the page.</p>
